About me
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Toyama, Japan, specializing in computer vision and machine learning. My current work explores dataset distillation and diffusion models.

I hold a Master’s degree in Bioengineering, with experience in molecular biology (e.g., PCR, ELISA, plasmid construction) and bioinformatics (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, tumor sequencing). I am passionate about bridging disciplines—bringing insights from life sciences into AI applications—and have actively engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations, including joint research with the College of Food Science at Zhejiang Gongshang University. 

My recent work centers on advancing dataset distillation techniques and integrating them with generative models. I am passionate about bridging the gap between data efficiency and generation quality, aiming to develop scalable and practical solutions for real-world computer vision applications.
